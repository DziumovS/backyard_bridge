# Backyard bridge
Card game, very similar to UNO.  
There are no winners. Only losers.

### NUMBER OF PLAYERS
2 - 4

### MAIN RULES:
<b>1) Players are dealt</b> 5 cards each; the first player automatically plays a random card from his hand.  
<b>2) The game starts</b> with each player having 0 points. The number of points can range from negative infinity to more than 125.  
<b>3) If you score</b> more than 125 points, you lose. If you score exactly 125 points, your score resets to zero.  
<b>4) Only one</b> card can be played at a time (except for the Jack).  
<b>5) You can</b> play a card if it has the same rank (e.g., Queen on Queen), the same suit (e.g., Clubs on Clubs), or if it's a Jack.  
<b>6) A Jack</b> can be played on any rank or suit and in any quantity.  
<b>7) The game</b> can end early in two scenarios:  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;• If 4 cards of the same rank are played consecutively, the player who played the 4th card <b>can</b> call "Bridge" (exception - a card with a value of 6);  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;• If a player must draw a card from the deck, but there aren't enough cards in the deck.  
In these cases, all players will be given points based on their cards in their hands.  
<b>8) The point multiplier</b> increases by +1 with each reshuffle of the deck.  

### SPECIAL CARDS
<b>6</b> — You must cover it with a card of the same suit / rank / any Jack.  
<b>7</b> — The next player must draw 1 card.  
<b>8</b> — The next player must draw 2 cards and skip their turn.  
<b>Jack</b> — You must declare a suit for the next player; can be played on any card; can be played multiple.  
<b>Ace</b> — The next player must skip their turn.
